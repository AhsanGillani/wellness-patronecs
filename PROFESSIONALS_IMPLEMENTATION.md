# Find Professionals Page Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the "Find Professionals" page that fetches all professionals from the database and displays them with proper fallback handling.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Integration

- **Real-time Data Fetching**: Uses Supabase to fetch all professionals from the `professionals` table
- **Profile Integration**: Joins with the `profiles` table to get professional details (name, avatar, etc.)
- **Real Ratings**: Integrates with the `professional_ratings` view to display actual ratings and review counts
- **Fallback Values**: Provides sensible defaults when real data is not available

### 2. User Interface

- **Professional Cards**: Each professional is displayed in a clean, informative card format
- **Verification Badges**: Shows verified professionals with a green checkmark badge
- **Rating Display**: Shows star ratings and review counts
- **Action Buttons**: "View Profile" and "Book" buttons for each professional
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### 3. State Management

- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error display with user-friendly messages
- **Empty State**: Engaging message when no professionals are available

### 4. Data Structure

Each professional object contains:

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  profession: string;
  years_experience: number;
  rating: number;
  reviews: number;
  price_per_session: number;
  specialization: string;
  verification: string;
  slug: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```
